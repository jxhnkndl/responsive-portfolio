## Project Goals

This project required building a fully responsive web portfolio from scratch using the Bootstrap grid system and selected Bootstrap components. As specified by the project mockups, the live application contains an index/about page, a contact page, and a portfolio page. All three pages and their shared navbar and footer components cleanly respond to the Bootstrap breakpoints, creating a consistent viewing experience across laptop/desktop, tablet, and mobile devices. 

## Features

* **Fully Responsive Layout:** Built on Bootstrap's grid and breakpoint system, each page's layout is designed to be fully resposive across desktop, laptop, tablet, and mobile device sizes.
* **Fully Responsive Images:** All images are fluid and responsive across key breakpoints, ensuring that portfolio project images stay beautiful and tightly positioned no matter the screen size.
* **Responsive SVG Background:** Using **[SVGBackgrounds'](http://www.svgbackgrounds.com/)** free SVG generator, all pages are positioned over a responsive spiral pattern that expands and contracts depending on the device size.
* **Input Validation:** While the contact form is not fully functional, it does make use of Bootstrap's input validation on the required name and email fields. 
* **Sticky Footer:** Secondary navigation icons linking to LinkedIn, GitHub, and email are always easily accessible across pages.

## Portfolio Image Attribution

**A small note regarding images used on the Portfolio Page:** Since I don't have full-stack web development projects to use in this portfolio quite yet, I decided to use album art from real world projects I've completed in my current profession. All five of the images used in the porfolio section are directly taken from projects that I founded and fully or partially own. I have included front-facing attributions to the talented designers that worked on the cover art for each project.
