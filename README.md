[J.K. Royston - Responsive Bootstrap Portfolio](https://jxhnkndl.github.io/responsive-portfolio)

## Project Goals

This project required building a fully responsive portfolio site from scratch using the Bootstrap grid system and selected Bootstrap components. Based on the project mockups, the live application contains an index/about page, a contact page, and a portfolio page. All three pages and their shared navbar and footer components cleanly adapt to the Bootstrap breakpoints, creating a consistent viewing experience across laptop/desktop, tablet, and mobile devices. 

## Features

* **Fully Responsive Layout:** Built on Bootstrap's grid and breakpoint system, every component is designed to be fully resposive across laptop/desktop, tablet, and mobile device sizes.
* **Fully Responsive Images:** All images are fluid and responsive across devices, ensuring that portfolio projects stay beautiful and tightly positioned no matter the screen size.
* **Responsive SVG Background:** Using SVGBackgrounds.com's free generator, all pages have a responsive circular SVG background that responds to larger and smaller device sizes.
* **Sticky Footer:** The project's sticky footer keeps icons linking to LinkedIn, GitHub, and email easily accessible.

## Portfolio Image Attribution

**A small note regarding images used on the Portfolio Page:** Given that I don't have web development projects to use in this portfolio quite yet, I decided to use album art from real world projects in my current career. All five of these images are taken from projects that I remain a co-owner of and as such, I have included front-facing attributions to each of the designers below each image.

## Technologies
