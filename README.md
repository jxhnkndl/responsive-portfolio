[J.K. Royston - Responsive Bootstrap Portfolio](https://jxhnkndl.github.io/responsive-portfolio)

## Project Goals

This project required building a fully responsive web portfolio from scratch using the Bootstrap grid system and selected Bootstrap components. As specified by the project mockups, the live application contains an index/about page, a contact page, and a portfolio page. All three pages and their shared navbar and footer components cleanly adapt to the Bootstrap breakpoints, creating a consistent viewing experience across laptop/desktop, tablet, and mobile devices. 

## Features

* **Fully Responsive Layout:** Built on Bootstrap's grid and breakpoint system, each page's layout is designed to be fully resposive across desktop, laptop, tablet, and mobile device sizes.
* **Fully Responsive Images:** All images are fluid and responsive across breakpoints, ensuring that portfolio project images stay beautiful and tightly positioned no matter the screen size.
* **Responsive SVG Background:** Using **[SVGBackgrounds'](http://www.svgbackgrounds.com/)** free SVG generator, all pages are positioned over a responsive circular pattern that adapts to larger and smaller device sizes.
* **Input Validation:** While the contact form is not fully functional, it does make use of Bootstrap's input validation on the name and email fields. 
* **Sticky Footer:** The project's sticky footer keeps secondary navigation icons linking to LinkedIn, GitHub, and email easily accessible.

## Portfolio Image Attribution

**A small note regarding images used on the Portfolio Page:** Given that I don't have full-stack web development projects to use in this portfolio quite yet, I decided to use album art from real world projects completed in my current profession. All five of these images are directly taken from projects that I remain a co-owner of. I have included front-facing attributions to each of the designers below each project image.
